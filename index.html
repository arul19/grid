                In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem,<br>
                 or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species.<br>
                  In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower,<br>
                   including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants<br>
                    that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.<br>

            <div class= "bg-secondary col-sm-3 border border-light">
              <p>
                In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas,<br>
                 and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group<br> 
                 but include a variety of plant species that have independently<br>
                evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants<br>
                 to compete for sunlight.

            A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground<br>
            by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength,<br>
            and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another.<br>
             For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier.<br>

          universally recognised precise definition of what a tree is,<br>
           either botanically or in common language.  </div>
        <div class="bg-dark col-sm-1   text-white"> In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the general form of an elongated stem, </div>
        <div class="bg-info col-sm-1 border border-light">or trunk, which supports the photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.</div>
        <div class="bg-success col-sm-1  ">Trees are also typically defined by height,with smaller</div>
        <div class="bg-secondary col-sm-1 ">   plants from 0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called shrubs,</div>
        <div class="bg-primary col-sm-1 border border-light"> so the minimum height of a tree is only loosely defined. </div>
        <div class="bg-warning col-sm-1 ">Large herbaceous plants such as papaya and bananas are trees in this broad sense.</div>
        <div class="bg-light col-sm-1 ">A commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a woody trunk formed by secondary growth,</div>
        <div class="bg-info col-sm-1 border border-light">meaning that the trunk thickens each year by growing outwards,</div>
        <div class="bg-success col-sm-1 ">  in addition to the primary upwards growth from the growing tip.</div>
        <div class="bg-dark col-sm-1 text-white ">Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as palms, bananas and papayas are not </div>
        <div class="bg-warning col-sm-1 border border-light ">considered trees regardless of their height, growth form or stem girth.</div>

                  Certain monocots may be considered trees under a slightly looser <br>
                  definition; while the Joshua tree, bamboos and palms do not have<br>
                  secondary growth and never produce true wood with growth rings,<br>
                  they may produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying cells formed by primary growth.<br>
